# Projected Timeline

### Sprint 1
Divide 6BG worth of data into chunks to be distributed evenly among group members.

Label 6BG worth of frames collected from the Quad Cam and label them using CVAT.

Example labels include:

activity
-frisbee
-spikeball
-exercise
-other

lounging
-sitting
-standing
-laying 
-other

traversing
-biking
-running
-walking
-other

all above labels should attribute checkbox: group

animal
-dog
-squirrel
-other

### Sprint 2

Get roughly around 200 frames per person of labelled images to train a model for automated annotation to do the rest of the annotations.

Go through automated annotations to ensure labels have been assigned properly.

Collect the data into one big file, to process for training CV model.

### Sprint 3

Fine-tune our model.

Implement our model somewhere to be able to demonstrate its ability to detect objects in the Quad Cam.

Prepare for midterm presentation.

### Sprint 4

Host model in web server.

Get live feed object detection from Quad Cam.

### Sprint 5

Implementing additional features TBD.
